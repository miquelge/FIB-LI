leftmost
Label the variables in the order they occur in Vars. This is the default.
ff
First fail. Label the leftmost variable with smallest domain next, in order to detect infeasibility early. This is often a good strategy.
ffc
Of the variables with smallest domains, the leftmost one participating in most constraints is labeled next.
min
Label the leftmost variable whose lower bound is the lowest next.
max
Label the leftmost variable whose upper bound is the highest next.
The value order is one of:

up
Try the elements of the chosen variable's domain in ascending order. This is the default.
down
Try the domain elements in descending order.
The branching strategy is one of:

step
For each variable X, a choice is made between X = V and X #\= V, where V is determined by the value ordering options. This is the default.
enum
For each variable X, a choice is made between X = V_1, X = V_2 etc., for all values V_i of the domain of X. The order is determined by the value ordering options.
bisect
For each variable X, a choice is made between X #=< M and X #> M, where M is the midpoint of the domain of X.
At most one option of each category can be specified, and an option must not occur repeatedly.

The order of solutions can be influenced with:

min(Expr)
max(Expr)
